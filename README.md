# Run Bayes

In 2016 I had the crazy goal of running 1000 miles in 52 weeks. Being a data scientist, I decided to model my chances of success. This repository contains my data, my codes, and some output from my analysis. For more details see [here](https://chrisdienes.github.io/blog/2017/08/25/run-bayes). 

I decided to perform a Bayesian analysis with priors selected to achieve a 50% initial success likelihood. The result is depicted in the following gif:
